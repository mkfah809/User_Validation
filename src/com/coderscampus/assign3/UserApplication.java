The goal for this assignment will be to mimic a user login from a Java console application.
You will prompt a user for a username and a password, and then use the inputs you receive 
to validate whether or not the username / password combination is valid.
In order to validate this username / password combination, 
you'll need to read this information from a file (called "data.txt") and import the data into your Java application
